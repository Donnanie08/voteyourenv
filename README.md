Introduction

ByteHacks we attended was a 24-hour hackathon, the main goal of this hackathon was to encourage women of all ages and skillsets to form teams and create tech projects that have positive social impact. 
Our team advocated people putting environmental friendly lifestyles into actions. 
In this case, we developed full GUI in Javascript for visualizing different choices of lifestyle with real time polling technology. 
Users will be able to plant a tree or put a fresh cloud based on your selection on lifestyles. 
This will give people a straightforward sense that how their actions can make a difference! Data that users’ various choices made in different physical locations will be synchronized on the live voting section page.
